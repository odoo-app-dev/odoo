# Odoo installation
odoo is a powerful opensource platform which it is mainly based on python as backend and javascript as frontend. These combination gives you a variety of abililities to manage your data driven environment.
As a developer you need to build your own development environment.
In general, odoo somehow compile's all of its apps to make sure it is running fast and minified. It means that any change on an app needs to do odoo service restart or the app upgrade.
Changing on python codes require an odoo service reload. On the other hand, changing on xml files, javascript codes, css files, needed to have a app upgrade to apply changes.
It means that you need to be aware of what you are working on and do the right action to apply changes.
